\chapter{Artificial Neural Networks}
\label{chapt:nnets}
To better understand the the principles and limitation of object detection using artificial neural networks we will provide a brief overview of the basic concepts of artificial neural networks in this chapter. We will cover the principles behind single artificial neuron and algorithms used for training and inference on the network. Then we will focus on the composition of deep networks and their layers.

\section{Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks}
This section introduces the concept of artificial neuron and creating a network of them. We will take a deeper look at different functions and algorithms that make the network work and discuss the possible uses of such network.
