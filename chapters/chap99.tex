\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}
 We began our thesis by briefly summarizing a development of classification networks. We provided an overview of architecture of multiple generations of classifiers, from Alexnet (2012) to NASNet(2017).
 
 and region based detection networks. In \cref{chap:related} we performed an in-depth study of state-of-the-art detection networks, YOLO and SSD. We also researched the option of utilizing the temporal information from consecutive video frames, and reviewed two such detectors, Tube-CNN nad TSSD.
